\chapter{Preface}
\start{T}{his} thesis was written within the \href{https://www.scienze.unifi.it/upload/sub/convenzione-complutense-testo-firmato.pdf}{Agreement} between Universidad Complutense de Madrid (Madrid, Spain) and Universit√† degli Studi di Firenze (Florence, Italy). As prescribed by the agreement, I was a visiting scholar for a period of 6 months, from September 2019 to February 2020. 

During this period, I approached the field of Operative Research. I had the opportunity to study in Prof. Angel Felipe Ortega's \emph{Advanced Optimization Techniques} course at UCM. Within this course, I became interested in heuristic methods  and Prof. Ortega agreed to supervise my Master's thesis project on Quadratic Assignment Problem.
 
My thesis advisor at University of Florence is Prof. Stefania Bellavia. She helped me to place my work in a broader context, making it more organic and to improve the presentation, with a constant, scrupulous and meticulous \textit{labor limae}.


I would like to thank Prof. Bellavia and Prof. Ortega for their invaluable guidance, for their dedication and their patience.
